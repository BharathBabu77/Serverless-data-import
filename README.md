Project Title: Serverless Data Import from S3 to DynamoDB with Lambda

Project Description:

This project involves designing and implementing a serverless data import pipeline using AWS Lambda functions to automatically transfer data from Amazon S3 into Amazon DynamoDB. The pipeline is triggered by S3 events, allowing for real-time data ingestion.

Technologies Used:

AWS Lambda
Amazon S3
Amazon DynamoDB
AWS CloudFormation
Python
Serverless Architecture

Execution Steps:

Clone the repository:  git clone <repository_url> 
Set up the AWS credentials and configure the AWS CLI on your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory:  cd serverless-data-import 
Install the project dependencies:  npm install 
Configure the project settings in the  config.json  file. This includes specifying the S3 bucket name, DynamoDB table name, and other necessary configurations.
Deploy the AWS CloudFormation stack using the following command:  npm run deploy 
The CloudFormation stack will provision the necessary AWS resources, including the Lambda function, S3 bucket, and DynamoDB table.
Once the stack is deployed successfully, any new file uploads to the specified S3 bucket will trigger the Lambda function.
The Lambda function, written in Python, will parse and transform the incoming data from the S3 files into the desired format.
The transformed data will be inserted into the specified DynamoDB table.
Monitor the pipeline's performance and troubleshoot any issues using AWS CloudWatch logs and DynamoDB monitoring tools.

Additional Notes:

Make sure to have the necessary IAM permissions to deploy the AWS CloudFormation stack and execute Lambda functions.
It is recommended to follow best practices for error handling and retry mechanisms within the Lambda function to ensure data consistency and reliability.
Optimize the performance of the serverless data pipeline by monitoring resource utilization, identifying bottlenecks, and implementing optimizations to achieve cost-efficiency and scalability.
