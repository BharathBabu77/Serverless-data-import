Project Title: Serverless Data Import from S3 to DynamoDB with Lambda

Description: Successfully designed and implemented a serverless data import pipeline,
utilizing AWS Lambda functions to automatically transfer data from Amazon S3 into Amazon DynamoDB, triggered by S3 events.

Responsibilities and Achievements:

Developed a custom Lambda function using Pythonto parse and transform data from S3 files into DynamoDB.
Orchestrated the deployment of AWS CloudFormation templates to provision serverless resources, including Lambda, S3, and DynamoDB.
Configured S3 event notifications to trigger Lambda functions upon new file uploads, enabling real-time data ingestion.
Implemented error handling and retry mechanisms within Lambda to ensure data consistency and reliability.
Monitored and optimized the performance of the serverless data pipeline, achieving cost-efficiency and scalability.

Technologies Used: AWS Lambda, Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, AWS CloudFormation, Python, Serverless Architecture.
